# Type Tester

## Description
Type Tester is a typing game that draws inspiration from Type Racer (https://play.typeracer.com/). The motivation was to create a way for users to practice their typing speed and accuracy using prompts from our favorite movies. The result is a fun, interactive game where a user can create a profile, test their skills and see their scores. We hope everyone who comes across our game enjoys it as much as we do.
